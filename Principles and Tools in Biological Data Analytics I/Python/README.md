# ðŸ§  Exercise Notebook Guide

This repository contains **Python Jupyter Notebooks** for practicing programming and data analysis concepts.  
Each notebook is categorized as either **Guided** or **Debugging**, based on its filename.

## ðŸ“˜ Notebook Types

| Notebook Type | File Naming Rule | Purpose |
|----------------|------------------|----------|
| **Guided / Solution Notebook** | Filename **does NOT contain** the word `debug` | These notebooks contain **working examples** and explanations. Use them to study correct syntax, logic, and common programming patterns. |
| **Debugging Notebook** | Filename **contains** the word `debug` | These notebooks contain **broken code**. Your task is to **fix errors** (syntax, logic, or structure) or complete missing code so it performs as described. |

## ðŸ›  How to Work Through Debugging Notebooks

Each exercise typically includes **two types of code cells**:

1. **Solution Cell**
   - Contains the starting or incomplete code for you to fix.  
   - You will correct syntax or logic errors and fill in missing pieces.  
   - Run this cell **after making your edits** to check your work.

2. **Test & Solution Cell**
   - Contains test cases or expected outputs for verification.  
   - **Do not modify** this cell â€” just run it after your solution cell.  
   - It confirms whether your fix or implementation is correct.

## ðŸ§­ How to Work Through Guided Notebooks

Guided notebooks are fully functional and focus on **demonstrating concepts**.  
Follow these steps to get the most out of them:

1. Read the **markdown explanations** before each code block.  
2. Run the code cells in order using <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
3. Experiment by changing variables or inputs to observe how results change.  
4. Use these notebooks as references when solving debugging exercises.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

- **Read the problem statement carefully.**  
  Each exercise describes what the code is *supposed* to do â€” not always what itâ€™s currently doing.
- **Focus on intent, not just syntax.**  
  Sometimes the structure looks fine, but the logic or values are incorrect.
- **Use print statements or variable checks** to understand whatâ€™s happening before fixing it.
- **Compare with guided notebooks** after finishing â€” this helps solidify understanding.
