# 🧭 Guided R Practice for Biological Data Analytics I

This notebook introduces core R programming concepts with **working examples and explanations**.  
Each section corresponds to a typical beginner exercise, but here the code is **correct and annotated** to help you understand what’s happening.

---

## 🧮 1. Basic Operations

### Example 1: Arithmetic in R
```{r}
# R automatically treats numeric literals as doubles.
a <- 5
b <- 3
sum_ab <- a + b
sum_ab
```
**Explanation:** The `+` operator performs element-wise addition. Both `a` and `b` are numeric, so the result is `8`.

### Example 2: Division and Modulo
```{r}
x <- 11
y <- 3
quotient <- x %/% y  # integer division
remainder <- x %% y  # remainder
quotient; remainder
```
**Explanation:** `%/%` returns how many whole times `y` fits into `x`, while `%%` gives the leftover part.

---

## 🧵 2. Strings and Text

### Example 3: Concatenation
```{r}
first <- "Bio"
second <- "informatics"
phrase <- paste(first, second)
phrase
```
**Explanation:** `paste()` joins strings with a space by default. Use `paste0()` to join without spaces.

### Example 4: Substring Extraction
```{r}
dna <- "ACGT"
substr(dna, 2, 3)
```
**Explanation:** `substr(x, start, stop)` extracts characters from index positions 2 to 3, returning `"CG"`.

---

## 📊 3. Vectors and Factors

### Example 5: Creating and Summarizing Vectors
```{r}
nums <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
mean(nums)
sd(nums)
```
**Explanation:** Vectors are the core data structure in R. Functions like `mean()` and `sd()` compute statistics directly.

### Example 6: Factors (Categorical Data)
```{r}
species <- factor(c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica", "setosa"))
table(species)
```
**Explanation:** Factors represent categorical variables and store both the data and the allowed levels.

---

## 📁 4. Data Frames

### Example 7: Creating a Data Frame
```{r}
df <- data.frame(id = 1:4,
                 species = c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica", "setosa"),
                 mass = c(5.1, 5.8, 6.3, 5.0))
df
```
**Explanation:** A `data.frame` is like a spreadsheet—columns can be of different types.

### Example 8: Filtering Rows
```{r}
subset(df, mass > 5.5)
```
**Explanation:** The `subset()` function filters rows based on logical conditions.

---

## 📈 5. Visualization with ggplot2

### Example 9: Scatter Plot
```{r, message=FALSE}
# If ggplot2 is not installed uncomment the line below to install it. You need to do it once. After it's installed you can use a comment before it so it doesnt run again.
# install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(x = id, y = mass, color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Mass by ID", x = "ID", y = "Mass (g)")
```
**Explanation:** `ggplot2` uses a layered grammar of graphics. You start with `ggplot()`, define aesthetics, and add layers such as `geom_point()`.

---

## 🔍 6. Simple Grouped Analysis

### Example 10: Summarize by Group
```{r}
# If ggplot2 is not installed uncomment the line below to install it. You need to do it once. After it's installed you can use a comment before it so it doesnt run again.
# install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
df %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_mass = mean(mass))
```
**Explanation:** `group_by()` and `summarise()` are part of the `dplyr` grammar for aggregation.
