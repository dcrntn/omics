# Exercise Notebook Guide

This notebook contains exercises designed to reinforce the concepts from the lectures. Your primary tasks are **fixing errors** and **writing missing code solutions**.

## ðŸ›  How to Run the Exercises

Each exercise is structured with **two Code cells**. Please follow this two-step process for every exercise:

1.  **Work in the Solution Cell:**
    * Locate the first cell (the one containing the initial code or the blank space for your solution).
    * Your only focus should be **fixing the errors** (syntax or logic) or **writing your complete solution** in this cell.
    * **Run this cell first** to execute your corrected or newly written code.

2.  **Verify with the Test & Solution Cell:**
    * After running the first cell, run the second cell, typically labeled **Test & Solution**.
    * This cell will check your output against the expected result and help you verify if your solution is correct. **Do not modify the code in this cell.**

## ðŸ’¡ Key Advice for Success

* **Read the Description:** The most important step is to **always read the exercise description carefully**. Errors are not always simple syntax mistakes; sometimes the logic, formulas, or numbers used in the code are simply *wrong* according to the exercise's requirements.
* **Solve for the Goal:** Ensure your code produces the output described in the exercise, even if the existing code looks structurally sound. The "error" might be a simple incorrect variable assignment or an off-by-one number.
